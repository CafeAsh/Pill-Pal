## What is Pill Pal?

Pill Pal is a pill dispensing device developed by Team Fire through the course of UCLA's 2025 ECE 180DA/DW Capstone course.

Medication nonadherence poses serious risks, including hospitalization and mortality. Managing multiple medications demands strict adherence to schedules, accurate dosage measurement, and proper pill identification. In the United States alone, 43% of adults aged 65 and older take five or more prescription drugs.

Pill Pal simplifies medication management by offering an intuitive device for scheduling and dispensing pills. Unlike existing solutions like Hero Health and Meda Cube, Pill Pal stands out with advanced verification capabilities. It employs computer vision to not only count pills but also accurately identify them, reducing errors caused by both device and user.

## Scope of Project

* Aimed at individuals aged 65 and older, as well as their caregivers. 
* Accommodates pills ranging from 5mm to 21mm in size. 
* Compact design fits within maximum dimensions of 24in x 24in x 18in.
* Primary focus on pill verification subsystem.
* Outsourced pill retrieval method; no development efforts in this area.
* Targeting a verification error rate of less than 0.5%.
